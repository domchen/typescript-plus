THE ISSUE TRACKER IS NOT FOR QUESTIONS.

DO NOT CREATE A NEW ISSUE TO ASK A QUESTION.

IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR TYPESCRIPT CODE, DO NOT ASK A QUESTION HERE.

Tens of thousands of TypeScript questions have been asked and answered on StackOverflow; see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript . You can ask questions there or on other websites.

The only exception is if you have a question about *the TypeScript compiler API itself*. Please post a complete example of what you're trying to do and precisely describe what your question is.
