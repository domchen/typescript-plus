tests/cases/compiler/contextualTyping39.ts(1,11): error TS2352: Conversion of type '() => string' to type '() => number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'string' is not comparable to type 'number'.
