title: Vim Setup
---

Vim users can simply install either [sbdchd](https://github.com/sbdchd)/[neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat), [w0rp](https://github.com/w0rp)/[ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale), or [prettier](https://github.com/prettier)/[vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier).

---

## Neoformat

### Neoformat - Installation

Add [sbdchd](https://github.com/sbdchd)/[neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) to your list based on the tool you use:

```
Plug 'sbdchd/neoformat'
```

### Neoformat - Usage

Then make Neoformat run on save:

```
autocmd BufWritePre *.js Neoformat
```

### Neoformat - Other `autocmd` events

You can also make Vim format your code more frequently, by setting an `autocmd` for other events. Here are a couple of useful ones:

* `TextChanged`: after a change was made to the text in Normal mode
* `InsertLeave`: when leaving Insert mode

For example, you can format on both of the above events together with `BufWritePre` like this:

```
autocmd BufWritePre,TextChanged,InsertLeave *.js Neoformat
```

See `:help autocmd-events` in Vim for details.

### Neoformat - Customizing Prettier

If your project requires settings other than the default Prettier settings, you can pass arguments to do so in your `.vimrc` or [vim project](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Project_specific_settings), you can do so:

```
autocmd FileType javascript setlocal formatprg=prettier\ --stdin\ --parser\ flow\ --single-quote\ --trailing-comma\ es5
" Use formatprg when available
let g:neoformat_try_formatprg = 1
```

Each space in prettier options should be escaped with `\`.

## vim-prettier

![vim-prettier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prettier/vim-prettier/master/media/vim-prettier.gif?raw=true "vim-prettier")

### vim-prettier - Installation

Install with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), assumes node and yarn|npm installed globally.

By default it will auto format **javascript**, **typescript**, **less**, **scss** and **css** files that have "@format" annotation in the header of the file.

```
" post install (yarn install | npm install) then load plugin only for editing supported files
Plug 'prettier/vim-prettier', {
    \ 'do': 'npm install',
    \ 'for': ['javascript', 'typescript', 'css', 'less', 'scss'] }
```

If using other vim plugin managers or doing manual setup make sure to have `prettier` installed globally or go to your vim-prettier directory and either do `npm install` or `yarn install`

When installed via vim-plug, a default prettier executable is installed inside vim-prettier.

vim-prettier executable resolution:

1.  Traverse parents and search for Prettier installation inside `node_modules`
2.  Look for a global prettier installation
3.  Use locally installed vim-prettier prettier executable

### vim-prettier - Usage

Prettier by default will run on auto save but can also be manually triggered by:

```
<Leader>p
```

or

```
:Prettier
```

If your are on vim 8+ you can also trigger async formatting by:

```
:PrettierAsync
```

### vim-prettier - Configuration

Disable auto formatting of files that have "@format" tag

```
let g:prettier#autoformat = 0
```

The command `:Prettier` by default is synchronous but can also be forced async

```
let g:prettier#exec_cmd_async = 1
```

By default parsing errors will open the quickfix but can also be disabled

```
let g:prettier#quickfix_enabled = 0
```

To enable vim-prettier to run in files without requiring the "@format" doc tag. First disable the default autoformat, then update to your own custom behaviour

Running before saving sync:

```
let g:prettier#autoformat = 0
autocmd BufWritePre *.js,*.css,*.scss,*.less Prettier
```

Running before saving async (vim 8+):

```
let g:prettier#autoformat = 0
autocmd BufWritePre *.js,*.css,*.scss,*.less PrettierAsync
```

Running before saving, changing text or leaving insert mode:

```
" when running at every change you may want to disable quickfix
let g:prettier#quickfix_enabled = 0

let g:prettier#autoformat = 0
autocmd BufWritePre,TextChanged,InsertLeave *.js,*.css,*.scss,*.less PrettierAsync
```

**Vim-prettier default formatting settings are different from the prettier defaults, but they can be configured**

```
" max line lengh that prettier will wrap on
g:prettier#config#print_width = 80

" number of spaces per indentation level
g:prettier#config#tab_width = 2

" use tabs over spaces
g:prettier#config#use_tabs = 'false'

" print semicolons
g:prettier#config#semi = 'true'

" single quotes over double quotes
g:prettier#config#single_quote = 'true'

" print spaces between brackets
g:prettier#config#bracket_spacing = 'false'

" put > on the last line instead of new line
g:prettier#config#jsx_bracket_same_line = 'true'

" none|es5|all
g:prettier#config#trailing_comma = 'all'

" flow|babylon|typescript|postcss
g:prettier#config#parser = 'flow'
```

## ALE

### ALE - Installation

[ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) is an asynchronous lint engine for Vim that also has the ability to run formatters over code, including Prettier. For ALE to work you'll have to be using either Vim 8 or Neovim as ALE makes use of the asynchronous abilities that both Vim 8 and Neovim provide.

The best way to install ALE is with your favourite plugin manager for Vim, such as [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```
Plug 'w0rp/ale'
```

You can find further instructions on the [ALE repository](https://github.com/w0rp/ale#3-installation).

### ALE - Usage

Once you've installed ALE you need to enable the Prettier fixer:

```
let g:ale_fixers = {}
let g:ale_fixers['javascript'] = ['prettier']
```

ALE will first use the Prettier installed locally (in `node_modules/.bin/prettier`) before looking for a global installation.

You can then run `:ALEFix` in a JavaScript file to run Prettier.

### ALE - Configuration

To have ALE run `prettier` when you save a file you can tell ALE to run automatically:

```
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
```

To configure Prettier, you can set `g:ale_javascript_prettier_options`. This is a string that will be passed through to the Prettier command line tool:

```
let g:ale_javascript_prettier_options = '--single-quote --trailing-comma es5'
```

If you use Prettier config files, you must set `g:ale_javascript_prettier_use_local_config` to have ALE respect them:

```
let g:ale_javascript_prettier_use_local_config = 1
```

---

## Running manually

### Running Prettier manually in Vim

If you need a little more control over when prettier is run, you can create a custom key binding. In this example, `gp` (mnemonic: "get pretty") is used to run prettier (with options) in the currently active buffer:

```
nnoremap gp :silent %!prettier --stdin --trailing-comma all --single-quote<CR>
```
