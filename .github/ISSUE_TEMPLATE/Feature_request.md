My suggestion meets these guidelines:
* [ ] This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript / JavaScript code
* [ ] This wouldn't change the runtime behavior of existing JavaScript code
* [ ] This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions
* [ ] This isn't a runtime feature (e.g. new expression-level syntax)
